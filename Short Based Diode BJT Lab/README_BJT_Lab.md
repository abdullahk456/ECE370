# BJT and Short-Base Diode Lab

This lab investigates the behavior of short-base vs. long-base diodes and simulates bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) using NanoHub.

## 🔍 Objectives
- Explore minority carrier concentration in short- and long-base diodes.
- Simulate current density vs. position in a BJT.
- Evaluate current gain (β), base width modulation, and collector current.

## 📈 Key Concepts
- Diffusion vs. recombination
- Minority carrier dynamics
- β vs. Ic plots and VTCs
- Gummel plots
